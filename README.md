## Password Generator 

## Description 
My motivation for this website is to help create multiple customizable passwords for users. With questions such as if the user wants special characters, uppercase letters, lowercase letters or mumnbers. This allows the user to be creative and in controll of their password options while still recieving a unique randomly generated password.
